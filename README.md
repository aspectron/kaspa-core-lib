**A pure and powerful JavaScript Bitcoin *Cash* library.**

## Principles

Bitcoin Cash is another powerful peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for highly resilient bitcoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement bitcoin apps and services.

## Bitcoin Cash changes

Bitcoin cash uses a different `sighash` for transaction signatures. The implementation in bitcore-cash has been tested against the original bitcoin-cash test vectors (see sighash.json in `/test`). `bitcoin-cash` modifications in script evaluation have not been implemented yet.

## Get Started

```sh
npm install kaspacore-lib
```

Adding Kaspacore Cash to your app's `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "kaspacore-lib": "=0.18.0",
    ...
}
```

## Documentation

The complete docs are hosted here: [bitcore documentation](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore). There's also a [bitcore API reference](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/packages/bitcore-node/docs/api-documentation.md) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, where you'll find low-level details on each bitcore utility.

## Building the Browser Bundle

To build a bitcore-lib full bundle for the browser:

```sh
gulp browser
```

This will generate files named `kaspacore-lib.js` and `kaspacore-lib.min.js`.

You can also use our pre-generated files, provided for each release along with a PGP signature by one of the project's maintainers. To get them, checkout the [releases](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/packages/kaspacore-lib/CHANGELOG.md).

## Development & Tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bitpay/kaspacore-lib
cd kaspacore-lib
npm install
```

Run all the tests:

```sh
gulp test
```

You can also run just the Node.js tests with `gulp test:node`, just the browser tests with `gulp test:browser`
or create a test coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it) with `gulp coverage`.

## Security

We're using Kaspacore in production, as are many others, but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.

If you find a security issue, please email security@bitpay.com.
